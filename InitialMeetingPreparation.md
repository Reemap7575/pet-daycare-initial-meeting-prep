# Pet Daycare â€“ Initial Client Meeting Preparation

## 1. Assumptions

- The Pet Daycare currently lacks a standardized digital system for client or employee onboarding.
- Employee onboarding processes are inconsistent and depend heavily on individual trainers.
- Client onboarding steps vary by employee, causing confusion and frustration.
- No current software system is being used to manage onboarding workflows.
- Owners want to improve internal efficiency and customer satisfaction by reducing onboarding friction.
- There is willingness from the client to adopt a digital solution for consistency and automation.

## 2. Broken Down Requirements

- Implement a consistent, digital workflow for new client onboarding.
- Design a structured training program to streamline new employee onboarding.
- Ensure all employees follow a standardized client intake process.
- Decrease the time required to train new employees from 3 months to under 1 month.
- Improve communication between clients, employees, and the management team.
- Introduce tools or platforms to reduce manual paperwork and streamline operations.

## 3. Questions to Ask the Client

### Onboarding Process for Clients:
- Can you describe your current client onboarding process step-by-step?
- What specific data is collected from a new client?
- How are appointments, vaccinations, and pet details recorded?
- Are physical forms or digital methods currently used?

### Employee Onboarding:
- What does the current employee training journey look like?
- Are there formal checklists, SOPs, or documents used during training?
- How do you evaluate when an employee is fully trained?
- Which training areas are most time-consuming or inconsistent?

### Technical/Process Context:
- Are you using any management software for scheduling or records?
- Do you track onboarding status using spreadsheets or on paper?
- Is there any resistance among staff to adopting new digital tools?

### Goals and Success Criteria:
- What would a smooth onboarding experience look like from your perspective?
- Which onboarding process (client or employee) is a higher priority to fix first?
- What would you consider a successful improvement (e.g., 50% time reduction, 100% consistency)?

## 4. Follow-up Clarification Questions

- How many clients do you typically onboard each month?
- What is the average number of new hires per year?
- Do different employees have different roles during onboarding (e.g., trainer, greeter)?
- Is there an existing internal documentation system we can integrate with?
- Do you need multilingual support for clients or staff?
- Are you open to using third-party onboarding tools (e.g., Typeform, Notion, Trello)?

## 5. Preliminary Tasks

- Research onboarding best practices for pet care and service-based businesses.
- Create user journey maps for both employee and client onboarding flows.
- Design standardized client intake forms.
- Develop an internal employee onboarding checklist and progress tracker.
- Prototype a digital onboarding interface (form, portal, or app).
- Define metrics to evaluate onboarding success (time, accuracy, satisfaction).
- Document current pain points from all user perspectives (owners, employees, clients).
- Schedule internal walkthrough sessions with the Pet Daycare team.
